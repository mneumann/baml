HTML escaping within text?

div {
  "This is text"
  "This too"

  @raw 'abc def ehj'

  @raw ~{
    This is also text with <b>being</b> being replaced?
  }

  @interpolate 'abc ${abc}'
  @raw "abc ${abc}"

'abcdef' == @raw"abcdef"
@r @escapehtml ~{
}

@escapehtml "hallo <b>this is not bold</b>"

div ^{
  This can contain <b>HTML tags</b>.
}

div ~{
  While this cannot <b>. Is it useful?
}

No, I think we always want to allow HTML in strings, so
that we can include &amp; and other special characters, no?

Both would esacpe interpolations in the same way.

^"hallo &amp; this can include HTML?" # => @raw "hallo &amp; this can include HTML unescaped"
"hallo & this can not include HTML" # => @escape "hallo & this can not include HTML"

# @escape is the default
@raw @raweval @eval
